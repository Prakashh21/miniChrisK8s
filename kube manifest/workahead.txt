##

fix the ports that couldn't be created
figure if env variables are correctly passed or not
test services
check if we can use cluster IP in pfcon
figure out a way to use storebase , without chmod 777 , check if the trick used in miniChRIS would be applicable here or not.
think of a way that how would you handle depends on services in the cluster.


## ports issue important services

chris_db                      // service created
chris_store_db                // service created
queue                         
scheduler                     // service created
worker                        // service created
worker_periodic               // service created
